# Obsidian Vault Creation
This script automates the creation of a Vault for the Obsidian note-taking app.

The user inputs a name for the vault and the script then creates the folder structure and initial notes as defined in a dictionary inside the script

## To Do:
* Provide support for creating nested folders
* Provide a way to define structure and notes externally so it isn't hardcoded.
